## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep turquoise (#468499) for a sense of technology, progress, and a nod to the rivers and reservoirs used in hydroelectricity generation in Uzbekistan. Chosen instead of the clich√© 'green' for sustainability. Primary color contrasts with the dark background.
- Background color: Dark slate gray (#2B3035) to create a modern and sophisticated look.
- Accent color: Warm amber (#FFB347) for interactive elements like map markers and buttons. Use this for CTAs.
- Use clear, sans-serif fonts for map labels and side panel information to ensure readability.
- Consistent use of icons to represent station types (AC, DC, Hybrid) on the map and in the side panel.
- The map should take up the majority of the screen, with a collapsible side panel for station details.
